Frontend Mentor - Profile card component solution

Build with - HTML5 and CSS.

In this challenge, i learned how to use and place a .svg file using "background-image", "background-position" and various forms to align items and elements with "display: flex".

It is one of the projects I'm using to learn more about coding, definitively not perfect, but practice makes perfect.

With help of https://devemdobro.com/matriculas-abertas/ and https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/profile-card-component-with-multiple-background-images-controlling-TrREr6YsmD helping me place the svg image.
